Bad UI examples (based on my opinion)
## 1. https://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/

### Impression 
First of all, like (maybe) any other else. I tried to search "The worst website ever" on google, and this what came on the top list. My first impression was like "Oh wow", tho it's not really that bad. Why? because the content doesn't really matter since the website dont have any spesific function. It's almost like the result of a 9 years old kid who tried his/her first html and css lesson. But (if) the web should be used in other more important usability site which will need to be visited by people who has their important business, surely it would be disaster.

#### Flaws :
- Unnecessary styled big words 
- Too much animation (it's so distracting)
- Bad color choices
- Bad thread placement
- Misplacement of widgets

#### Solution:
- less distractive styled words, cuz the meaning much more important
- Consider using color based on psychology aspect and eye catching but not boring
- Widgets is supossed to be a support element in website, so dont overdo it

### Impression 
So i was looking for this book online till i got to visit many websites. And there's this one looking so plain in my eyes. This site shows completely boring colors for me, all bland. That the first time i clicked it on google, i did.t really consider to check all the book specification. (Sorry). By the way, the web was kinda simple.

#### FLaws :
- Colors are important 

#### Solution:
- Use colors
- Consider add some feature like recomendation

Thought it wasnt really bad designed, what makes me bothered is the ads. So many of them, like... it's not fully their own site
 (lol) (I think the web development went not really good)
#### Flaws :
- Too many ads

#### Solution :
- Show minimal amount of advertising, or at least make it somehow professional(?)
